A breadboard adapter for the PCM2906C: A USB 1.1 audio codec made by Texas Instruments. Note: the way the header pinout is defined, this board is only intended to be used *as a DAC.* However, you can choose to DNP the pull-down resistors on the VINR + VINL pins and solder jumpers onto the pad and use it that way.
